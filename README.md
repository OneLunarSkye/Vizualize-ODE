# Vizualize ODE with SciPy

This project is designed to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and visualize the solutions using Python. The program reads an ODE from the user, solves it, and then generates a visual representation of the solution using popular scientific computing libraries.

## Project Overview

In this project, we implement a mathematical model to solve ODEs and present the solution visually. The solution is displayed in the form of graphs to help the user understand the behavior of the system over time.

The project leverages Python's scientific libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to solve and visualize the ODEs efficiently. The program allows the user to input an ODE, solve it, and display the solution.

## Features

- **User Input**: Allows the user to input an ODE and its initial conditions.
- **ODE Solution**: Uses numerical methods to solve the ODE.
- **Visualization**: Displays the solution with a graphical representation (2D plot).
- **Error Estimates**: Provides error estimates for the numerical solution.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the required dependencies. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
